# Unexpected Behavior When Directly Modifying Instance Variables in Ruby

This example demonstrates a potential issue in Ruby when directly modifying instance variables using `instance_variable_set`.  While this method provides access to internal state, it circumvents the intended object interface and can lead to inconsistencies or maintainability problems.

The `bug.rb` file shows how modifying `@value` directly changes the object's state, bypassing the getter method. This can be problematic for several reasons: 

* **Encapsulation violation:** The intended design is to interact with the object's state using the `value` method, which might include additional logic or validation. Bypassing this can make the code harder to maintain and debug.
* **Unexpected side effects:** If the `value` method performs additional operations (e.g., logging, data transformation, or calculations), directly changing `@value` would skip those steps, creating inconsistencies or errors.
* **Debugging difficulties:** When the state of an object is changed unexpectedly, it can be significantly harder to track down the source of the problem.

The `bugSolution.rb` file offers a better approach that respects the object's interface and avoids the problems mentioned above.
